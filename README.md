# mailing-schedule

Design ideas:  
+ build Minimal Viable Product  
  + console  
  + clarify requirements:  
  if "the choices of multiple customers as input" to be continuous in time: use some persistence container (may be in-memory db)   
  if the input to happen once / (in a single point of time) than the solution would be a function:   
  Input -> BuildSchedule -> Output , without a state
