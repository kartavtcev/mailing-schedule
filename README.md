# mailing-schedule

Design ideas:  
+ build Minimal Viable Product. (If it's too simple - I can add features, but overengineering is also a mistake)    
  + console  
  + clarify requirements (I emailed this question to you, got no reply in 1 day & implemented simplest way):   
  ~if "the choices of multiple customers as input" to be continuous in time: use some persistence container (may be in-memory db)~     
  if the input to happen once / (in a single point of time) than the solution would be a function:   
  Input -> BuildSchedule -> Output , without a state   

Scala programming language  
IntelliJ IDEA IDE  
A few unit tests examples with ScalaTest, incl. example input/output correctness check.   
Code with lots of comments is a bad practice for production, but is an effective way to communicate in demo.
